## 💡 Inspiration

With approximately 300 million people worldwide having color vision deficiencies (8% of men and 0.5% of women), most digital art galleries ignore their accessibility needs. Huevid changes that by proving that accessibility and beauty aren't mutually exclusive—they're complementary forces that make art more powerful for everyone.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Hosting**: RunASP.NET
- **APIs**: National Gallery of Art API
- **Design**: Responsive Web Design principles
